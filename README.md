# POST COVID PROTECTION
As the process of Unlocking continues, we are moving towards more normal ways of lives. This presents us with the same situation as before lockdown, the need to contain the widespread of Corona Virus in working environments and public places. We have come up with a solution that is more effective to maintain all the required sanitization practices and social distancing norms in the public gathering places, malls and offices.
# ISSUE

As the process of Unlocking continues, we are moving towards more normal ways of lives. This presents us with the same situation as before lockdown, the need to contain the widespread of Corona Virus in working environments and public places. But this time we are at an advantage with all the healthy sanitization practices and social distancing norms.  Still we need to come up with more potent methods of disinfection and sterilization if we are to get our lives back to full normal. And also stricter methods to make the people abide by the various social distancing norms put in place. We have come up with a solution that is more effective to maintain all the required sanitization practices and social distancing norms in the public gathering places, malls and offices.

# SOLUTION

We have come up with a wholesome solution for the malls/offices. We have three different tech placed right from the entry to exit and from opening till shutdown of the mall/office which will assure people of their safety whilst inside the mall/office. 
1.	CoGate: A smart AI-based gate which will open if the person will be wearing the mask with a sanitizing pathway based on liquid sanitizing for humans and UV sanitization for electronic gadgets.
2.	Social Distancing Detector: It checks whether the people inside are maintaining the proper social distance as stated by the authorities.
3.	UV-Bot: It is a room disinfection device based in Ultraviolet-C radiation. It offers the capacity to be remotely programmed using an Android mobile device and it has an infrared detection security system that turns off the system when triggered.

# HOW IT WORKS
1.	Mask Detection: The smart gate will detect whether a person is wearing mask or not and the will allow the person only if he/she is wearing a mask. It will also monitor the number of people inside the gate and then allow people so that the people inside can maintain proper social distance.
2.	Sanitizing the people and their luggage: Upon entering the gate we have two separate chambers for sanitizing the people (with chemical sanitizers) and their luggage (using UV-C light).
3.	Maintaining social distance inside the mall: The social distance detection algorithm takes the real-time video feed from the CCTV and marks the people who are not in safe distances with a red box and the safe people with a green box in the output video. This in turn notifies the security personnel who see that proper distance is maintained.
4.	Sanitizing the compound: The UV-Bot is used to sanitize the whole compound after the mall/office is closed. It gives a real-time video feed to the user who can operate it remotely through Bluetooth using the Android app built to operate the bot. In the app the operator can also adjust the dosage value with the help of the built in dosage regulator algorithm.
